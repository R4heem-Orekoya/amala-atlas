# Amala Atlas 🍲🗺️

**Finding authentic Amala shouldn’t be luck.**  
Amala Atlas is a crowdsourced discovery & verification platform for locating the best Amala spots in Lagos (and beyond).  
Built for the **Amala Hackathon @ DevFest Lagos 2025**.

## 🚀 What is Amala Atlas?
Amala Atlas is a vertical discovery + verification layer (not just a Google Maps clone).  
It combines:
- **Crowdsourcing**: Users can add, review, and upload photos of Amala spots.  
- **Autonomous Discovery**: An agentic system that scrapes the public web (blogs, reviews, menus, directories) to propose possible Amala spots for community verification.  
- **Agentic Intake**: Users can submit spots via chat or voice, making contributions natural and fast.  
- **Map UI**: An interactive map for browsing and discovering authentic Amala spots nearby.  

The platform is **open source** so future generations can continue to grow and maintain it.
